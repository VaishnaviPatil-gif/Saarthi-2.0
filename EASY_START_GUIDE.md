### If Server Doesn't Start:

- Check if port 3000 is free

### If Browser Doesn't Open:
- Manually open `Saarthi.html` file
- Server status will show as "Online" when ready

### If Nothing Works:
- Use the original method: Open terminal, navigate to `server` folder, run `node index.js`

## 📝 Tips

### **Best Practice:**
Use the **desktop shortcut** - it's the easiest and most reliable method.

### **Keep Server Running:**
While using Saarthi, keep the command window open. Close it only when you're done.

### **Startup Time:**
First startup takes 3-5 seconds. Be patient!

### **Multiple Sessions:**
Don't start Saarthi twice - you'll get port conflicts. Use only one instance.
