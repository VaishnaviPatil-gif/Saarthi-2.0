## Testing Results

### ✅ Anxiety Response
**Before**: "I'm here and listening. (mood: anxious) Where do you feel the anxiety most in your body right now? [bullet points]"

**After**: "Anxiety can be really tough, especially when it feels like it's taking over everything. I want you to know that what you're feeling is valid and it's okay to not be okay right now.

Here's something that might help: try placing one hand on your chest and one on your belly. Breathe slowly and deeply, feeling your belly rise and fall. This simple act can help calm your nervous system.

Anxiety often makes us worry about the future. Try asking yourself: 'What can I control right now?' Focus on just the next small step, not the whole picture. You don't have to have it all figured out.

Is there something specific that's triggering the anxiety, or is it more of a general feeling?"

### ✅ Exam Stress Response
**Before**: "Thanks for sharing. (mood: anxious) Is there one small study task you'd feel okay starting? [suggestions] [try]"

**After**: "Exam pressure can feel overwhelming. I want you to know that feeling stressed about exams is completely normal - it means you care about doing well.

Let's make this manageable:

• Start with the easiest topic first. Getting a quick win builds momentum and confidence.
• Study in short bursts - your brain retains more this way than cramming for hours
• Create simple summary sheets or mind maps - visual learning sticks better
• Test yourself frequently - practice problems are gold
• Take care of basics: sleep, water, movement. A tired brain doesn't learn well.

When panic hits during study, stop and do this: name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste. It resets your nervous system.

You've prepared. Trust that process. What's your biggest concern about the exam?"

### ✅ Sleep Issues Response
**Before**: "How was your wind-down routine last night? [suggestions]"

**After**: "Not being able to sleep when you're exhausted is genuinely one of the most frustrating experiences. I get it.

The key is preparing your body for sleep before you even get into bed:

1. **2 hours before bed:** No heavy meals, cut caffeine
2. **1 hour before:** Screens away or use night mode/blue light filter
3. **30 minutes before:** Wind down - hot shower, gentle stretching, read something light
4. **In bed:** If your mind is racing, try counting backwards from 300 by 3s (boring enough to quiet the mind)

For racing thoughts:
• Keep a notepad by your bed - brain dump everything so you can release it
• Try the '3-3-3 rule': name 3 things you see, 3 sounds you hear, 3 ways you can move your body

Your bedroom should be for sleep only (not studying, not scrolling). Train your brain to associate bed with rest.

Sleep won't be perfect immediately, but consistency helps. When do you usually try to sleep?"

### ✅ Depression/Loneliness Response
**Before**: "Your feelings are valid. [suggestions]"

**After**: "Thank you for sharing this with me. Loneliness and sadness are painful, especially when it feels like nobody understands what you're going through.

You're not alone in feeling alone - that might sound contradictory, but so many people struggle with this. It doesn't make your pain less valid, but I hope it reminds you that connection is possible.

Small steps:
• **Reconnect gently** - send a simple message to someone: 'Hey, thinking of you' or 'Want to grab coffee?'
• **Find your people** - online communities, support groups, classes in something you're interested in
• **Do something kind for yourself** - make your favorite food, watch something comforting, journal your feelings
• **Create routine** - structure helps when everything feels chaotic inside

Depression lies to you. It tells you you're worthless, that nobody cares, that nothing will get better. These are lies. You matter, your feelings are valid, and things can change.

If you're struggling to function or having dark thoughts, please consider talking to a counselor or therapist. There's no shame in getting professional support.

What's one small thing you think you could do today for yourself?"
